# 🔰 NoiseShield AI
### Quantum-Inspired Offline Diagnostics for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2, 3, and 6)

---

## 🌍 Overview

**NoiseShield AI** is a **quantum-inspired, offline diagnostic system** that provides fast, interpretable, and noise-robust analysis for:
- **SDG 2 – Zero Hunger:** Soil Fertility & Crop Productivity
- **SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being:** Medical Health Screening
- **SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation:** Water Contamination Detection

This project uses **quantum interference-inspired ensemble learning** to enhance robustness under noisy sensor conditions.  
Built with **Streamlit**, it runs entirely **offline**, using lightweight logistic models with adaptive interference weights to simulate quantum stability.
